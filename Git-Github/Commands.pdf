📘 Git & GitHub Roadmap

A Beginner-to-Intermediate Learning Path

⚠️ Important Note (Before You Start)

The commands in this roadmap are intended for Linux-based terminals
(Linux, macOS, WSL, or Git Bash on Windows).

🔴 Windows Command Prompt (CMD) / PowerShell may not support all commands.
✅ Recommended environments:

Git Bash

WSL (Ubuntu)

VS Code Integrated Terminal

🧭 Roadmap Overview

This roadmap is divided into 6 progressive stages:

Command Line Fundamentals

Git Basics & Repository Setup

Staging & Committing Workflow

History Management & Undoing Changes

Branching & Collaboration

Working with GitHub (Remote Repositories)

Each stage builds on the previous one.

🟢 Stage 1: Command Line (CLI) Fundamentals

Before learning Git, it is essential to understand basic terminal commands used to manage files and directories.

Essential CLI Commands
Command	Description
mkdir folder_name	Creates a new directory
ls	Lists files and folders
ls -a	Shows hidden files (e.g. .git)
cd folder_name	Moves into a directory
cd ..	Moves back one directory
touch file.txt	Creates a new file
cat file.txt	Displays file contents

📌 These commands form the foundation of Git usage.

🟡 Stage 2: Initialising Git & Checking Status

This stage introduces Git and how it tracks project changes.

Git Setup Commands
Command	Purpose
git init	Initializes a Git repository
git status	Displays current project state

📂 git init creates a hidden .git directory which stores the complete version history.

🔵 Stage 3: Staging & Committing Changes

Git follows a two-step save process:

Stage files

Commit changes

Core Commands
Command	Function
git add file.txt	Stages a specific file
git add .	Stages all changes
git commit -m "message"	Saves a snapshot of changes
git restore --staged file.txt	Removes file from staging

🧠 Conceptual Analogy

Files → Guests

Staging area → Stage

Commit → Photograph

Git history → Photo album

🟣 Stage 4: Viewing History & Undoing Changes

This stage helps you review past work and recover from mistakes.

History & Recovery Commands
Command	Description
git log	Shows commit history
git reset commit_hash	Moves HEAD to previous commit
git reset --hard commit_hash	Deletes all later changes ⚠️
git stash	Temporarily saves uncommitted work
git stash pop	Restores stashed changes

⚠️ Use --hard carefully — changes cannot be recovered.

🟠 Stage 5: Branching & Merging

Branches allow developers to work independently without affecting the main codebase.

Branch Management Commands
Command	Purpose
git branch branch_name	Creates a new branch
git checkout branch_name	Switches branches
git checkout -b branch_name	Create & switch branch
git merge branch_name	Merges branch into current
git rebase -i commit_hash	Rewrites commit history

📌 Professional workflows always use branches.

🔴 Stage 6: Working with GitHub (Remote Repositories)

This stage connects local Git repositories with GitHub.

Remote Repository Commands
Command	Function
git clone url	Downloads a GitHub repository
git remote add origin url	Links repo to GitHub
git remote -v	Lists remote URLs
git push origin branch_name	Uploads commits
git fetch origin	Downloads updates
git pull origin branch_name	Fetch + merge updates

🧠 Key Concept
git pull = git fetch + git merge
