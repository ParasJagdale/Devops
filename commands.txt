General Command Line (CLI) Commands
Before diving into Git, the video introduces basic terminal commands used to manage files and folders:
• mkdir [folder_name]: Creates a new folder or directory.
• ls: Lists all files and folders in the current directory.
• ls -a: Shows all files, including hidden ones like the .git folder.
• cd [folder_name]: Changes the current directory to the specified folder.
• touch [filename]: Creates a new file.
• cat [filename]: Displays the contents of a file directly in the terminal.
Initialising and Status Commands
These commands are used to start a project and monitor its current state:
• git init: Initialises a new Git repository in the current folder, creating the hidden .git directory to track history.
• git status: Shows the current state of the project, identifying which files are modified, staged, or untracked.
Staging and Committing
Using the video's analogy, these commands move "guests" (files) onto the "stage" before taking a "photograph" (commit) for the "photo album" (history).
• git add [filename] or git add .: Adds specific files or all changes in the current directory to the staging area.
• git commit -m "[message]": Saves a snapshot of the staged changes to the repository's history with a descriptive message.
• git restore --staged [filename]: Removes a file from the staging area, essentially taking a "guest" off the "stage" before the "photo" is taken.
Viewing History and Undoing Changes
• git log: Displays the entire commit history of the project, showing who made changes and when.
• git reset [commit_hash]: Rewinds the project to a specific point in history by removing subsequent commits.
• git reset --hard [commit_hash]: Forcefully resets the project to a specific commit, discarding all changes made after that point.
• git stash: Temporarily saves modified files that are not yet ready to be committed, allowing for a "clean" working directory.
• git stash pop: Retrieves the most recently stashed changes and applies them back to the working directory.
Branching and Merging
Branches allow developers to work on new features in isolation without affecting the "Main" or "Master" branch.
• git branch [branch_name]: Creates a new branch.
• git checkout [branch_name]: Switches the working environment to the specified branch.
• git merge [branch_name]: Integrates the changes from one branch into the current active branch.
• git rebase -i [commit_hash]: An interactive way to rewrite history, often used to "squash" multiple small commits into a single, cleaner commit.
Working with Remote Repositories (GitHub)
• git clone [url]: Downloads an existing repository from GitHub to the local machine.
• git remote add [name] [url]: Links a local repository to a remote one on GitHub (the name is typically origin).
• git remote -v: Lists the remote URLs connected to the local repository.
• git push [remote] [branch]: Uploads local commits to the specified remote branch on GitHub.
• git fetch [remote]: Downloads updates from a remote repository without automatically merging them into the local code.
• git pull [remote] [branch]: A combination of fetch and merge; it retrieves updates from GitHub and immediately integrates them into the local branch.
